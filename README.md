## Description

This is a command line application that generates a webpage to display a work team's basic info. 

When you open the application type "node index" into the command line. You will be prompted to enter your team members and their information. Once you've finished entering team data, an HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster including hyperlinks to team member's emails and github profiles (github links open in a new tab, email links open your default email program). 

You may enter any number of interns, any numner of engineers, and one manager. For each team member you will provide their name, ID number, office number, and email. For each intern you will enter their school, for each engineer you will enter their github account. If any of these inputs are inproperly formatted you will be prompted to reenter the input. 

Once you have finished entering data, you will find your newly generated HTML file under "dist/index.html".
